## The training material

The main training presentation is in the Word document Intro to Git and Github.docx. The session also uses the PowerPoint presentation GitGitHub slides.pptx.

Training sessions are run several times a year by the Data and Analysis R and SQL Training Group. You can find a recording of a recent session in the [R/SQL/Git Training Video Library](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/RTrainingGroup/SitePages/video_collections.aspx?csf=1&web=1&share=EQmizR4ln25Hotr46oEK5_EB4dVwlRXdiOF0Xkyc1Mv9TA&e=wyNbpW)
