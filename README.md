# Intro to Git and GitHub training
### Run as part of the R training delivered by Data & Analysis

This repository provides accompanying training material used in the Introduction to Git/GitHub training session, conducted by the Data & Analysis R training group. 

Prior to joining the session, you should ensure you are set up on the Analytical Platform - see https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/get-started.html.

We expect participants to have completed the Introduction to using R on the Analytical Platform (or equivalent standard) and Introduction to R (or equivalent standard). Previous recordings and accompanying materials of sessions can be found here - https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/ap-tools-training/. 

You should then work through the following:
1.	Deploy (if necessary) and open RStudio: https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/tools/control-panel.html#control-panel
2.	Connect RStudio to GitHub: https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github.html#setup-github-keys-to-access-it-from-r-studio-and-jupyter
3.	Clone the GitHub repository for this course (https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_to_github_training) by following step 1 here: https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github.html#r-studio
4.	In the Console window in RStudio, enter this command to make sure you have the required packages installed: renv::restore()

## Contents

This training session will provide you with an understanding of what Git/GitHub is and explain the key benefits of using it alongside the Analytical Platform and RStudio. Step-by-step instructions will be provided about how to use GitHub in RStudio and how to collaborate effectively with others. Even if you are coding a one-off product, we highly recommend you use GitHub.

### Sessions aims
1.	What Git and GitHub are?
2.	Understanding how to use GitHub
3.	Ways to approach Git to enable effective use and collaboration
4.	Security considerations when using GitHub
5.	Further information and useful links
