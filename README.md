## Training sessions

The main training presentation is in the Word document [Intro to Git and Github.docx](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_to_github_training/blob/main/Intro%20to%20Git%20and%20Github.docx). The session also uses the PowerPoint presentation [GitGitHub slides.pptx](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_to_github_training/blob/main/GitGitHub%20slides.pptx).

Training sessions are run several times a year. You can find a recording of a recent session in the [training guide](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/ap-tools-training/ITG.html#gitgithub-training).

If you want to work through the material on your own, go through the Word document and switch to the PowerPoint presentation slides at the points it refers to them.
